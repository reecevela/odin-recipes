      <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 shallot, diced</li>
      <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>1/4 cup ranch dressing</li>
      <li>1/8 cup Buffalo sauce</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place chicken tenders into a medium-sized pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to medium-low and simmer until chicken tenders are cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain chicken tenders. Transfer to a cutting board and cut or shred as desired.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook shallot until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Combine cream cheese, ranch dressing, Buffalo sauce, and cooked shallots in a bowl; mix until creamy. Add cooked chicken and season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Spread Buffalo chicken mixture onto a tortilla and top with Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and Gouda cheese. Cover with a second tortilla and set quesadilla aside. Repeat with remaining tortillas, chicken mixture, and cheese.</li>
      <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Add 1 quesadilla and cook until browned on 1 side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until tortilla is crisp and cheese is melted, about 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining quesadillas.</li>
    </ol>
